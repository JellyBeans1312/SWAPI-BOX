# SWAPI-Box

SWAPI-Box is a web application that uses the Star Wars API to tap into a “black hole” of Star Wars data. Mwahaha.

## Learning Goals

The learning goals for this project are as follows:

- Write squeaky clean, well refactored code using ES6 syntax.
- Make informed design decisions to create a user-friendly application.
- Keep state based components to a minimum and leverage more functional components.
- Use a modular architecture for your application file structure.
- Think deeply about React Lifecycle Methods.
- Become familiar with promises, nested fetch requests, and handling the UI based on acceptance of data.
- Use propTypes for every component receiving props.
- Write tests for React components, asynchronous functionality, and route handling.
